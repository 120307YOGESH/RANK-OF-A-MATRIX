# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: 
Import the required library (numpy) in Python to perform matrix operations.

### Step 2: 
Define the matrix for which the rank is to be calculated.

### Step 3:
Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.

### Step 4: 
Display the rank of the matrix as the output.
